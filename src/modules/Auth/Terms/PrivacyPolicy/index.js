      <h3><em>8.&nbsp;</em>Your rights</h3>
      <h4><strong><em>8.1.&nbsp;</em></strong>Data protection law gives
        you a number of rights when it comes to personal information we hold about you.
        The key rights are set out below. More information about your rights can be obtained
        from the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO).&nbsp; Under certain circumstances, by law you have
        the right to:
      </h4>
      <h5><strong><em>8.1.1.&nbsp;</em></strong><strong>Be informed</strong> in a clear, transparent and
        easily understandable way about how we use your personal information and about
        your rights. This is why we are providing you with the information in this notice.
        If you require any further information about how we use your personal
        information, please let us know.
      </h5>
      <h5><strong><em>8.1.2.&nbsp;</em></strong><strong>Request access</strong> to your personal
        information (commonly known as a “data subject access request”). This enables
        you to receive a copy of the personal information we hold about you and to
        check that we are lawfully processing it.
      </h5>
      <h5><strong><em>8.1.3.&nbsp;</em></strong><strong>Request correction</strong> of the personal
        information that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or
        inaccurate information we hold about you corrected.
      </h5>
      <h5><strong><em>8.1.4.&nbsp;</em></strong><strong>Request erasure</strong> of your personal
        information. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal
        information where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it (for
        instance, we may need to continue using your personal data to comply with our
        legal obligations). You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your
        personal information where you have exercised your right to object to
        processing (see below).
      </h5>
      <h5><strong><em>8.1.5.&nbsp;</em></strong><strong>Object to processing</strong> of your personal
        information where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third
        party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you
        want to object to us using your information on this basis and we do not have a
        compelling legitimate basis for doing so which overrides your rights, interests
        and freedoms (for instance, we may need it to defend a legal claim). You also
        have the right to object where we are processing your personal information for
        direct marketing purposes.
      </h5>
      <h5><strong><em>8.1.6.&nbsp;</em></strong><strong>Request the restriction</strong> of processing of
        your personal information. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing
        of personal information about you, for example if you want us to establish its
        accuracy or the reason for processing it.
      </h5>
      <h5><strong><em>8.1.7.&nbsp;</em></strong><strong>Request the transfer</strong> of your personal
          information to another party where you provided it to us and we are using it
          based on your consent, or to carry out a contract with you, and we process it
          using automated means.
      </h5>
      <h5><strong><em>8.1.8.&nbsp;</em></strong><strong>Withdraw consent.</strong> In the limited
        circumstances where we are relying on your consent (as opposed to the other
        bases set out above) to the collection, processing and transfer of your personal
        information for a specific purpose, you have the right to withdraw your consent
        for that specific processing at any time. Once we have received notification
        that you have withdrawn your consent, we will no longer process your
        information for the purpose or purposes you originally agreed to, unless we
        have another legitimate interest in doing so.
      </h5>
      <h5><strong><em>8.1.9.&nbsp;</em></strong><strong>Lodge a complaint.</strong> If you think that we
        are using your information in a way which breaches data protection law, you
        have the right to lodge a complaint with your national data protection
        supervisory authority (if you are in the UK, this will be the ICO).
      </h5>
      <h4><strong><em>8.2.&nbsp;</em></strong>If you want to review,
        verify, correct or request erasure of your personal information, object to the
        processing of your personal information, withdraw your consent to the
        processing of your personal information or request that we transfer a copy of
        your personal information to another party, please contact us using the details
        at section 1.2.
      </h4>
      <h4><strong><em>8.3.&nbsp;</em></strong><strong>Marketing Purposes</strong></h4>
      <h4><strong><em>8.4.&nbsp;</em></strong>In addition to the rights set
        out above, you also have the right to ask us not to process your personal
        information for marketing purposes. We will usually inform you (before
        collecting your personal information) if we intend to use your personal
        information for such purposes or if we intend to disclose your information to
        any third party for such purposes. You can exercise your right to prevent such
        processing by checking certain boxes on the forms we use to collect your personal
        information.&nbsp; You can exercise the right
        at any time by contacting us using the details at section 1.2 in writing. You
        can also use the unsubscribe option in our marketing emails to unsubscribe from
        further marketing emails. Please note that where you unsubscribe from any
        postal marketing, you may initially still receive some content which has
        already been printed or sent, but we will remove you from any future campaigns.
      </h4>
      <h4><strong><em>8.5.&nbsp;</em></strong><strong>No fee usually required</strong></h4>
      <h4><strong><em>8.6.&nbsp;</em></strong>You will not have to pay a
        fee to access your personal information (or to exercise any of the other
        rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request for access is
        clearly unfounded or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with the
        request in such circumstances.
      </h4>
      <h4><strong><em>8.7.&nbsp;</em></strong><strong>What we may need from you</strong></h4>
      <h4><strong><em>8.8.&nbsp;</em></strong>We may need to request
        specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your
        right to access the information (or to exercise any of your other rights). This
        is another appropriate security measure to ensure that personal information is
        not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it.
      </h4>
      <h4><strong><em>8.9.&nbsp;</em></strong><strong>Timescale </strong></h4>
      <h4><strong><em>8.10.&nbsp;</em></strong>Please consider your
        request responsibly before submitting it. We will respond to your request as
        soon as we can. Generally, this will be within one month from when we receive
        your request but, if the request is going to take longer to deal with, we will
        let you know.
